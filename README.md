**#Urban Audio Classification**


This study explored the effectiveness of combining Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and YAMNet features in an RNN-LSTM model for audio classification. Initially, the fusion of both features was believed to increase accuracy and build a more robust model by leveraging both temporal and spectral features. However, it was found that this approach did not work well with audio waveforms as input. An attempt to feed MFCC into the YAMNet model and extract features was also unsuccessful due to insufficient computing power.
Further investigation showed that LSTM RNNs are well-suited for audio classification tasks due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and handle variable-length audio data. This is especially important as audio signals are time-varying and the audio data at any given point in time depends on the previous audio data. LSTM RNNs can effectively capture the patterns and structure in audio data by learning to remember relevant past audio data and disregard irrelevant audio data.
In summary, this study highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate model for audio classification tasks. While the fusion of different types of features may seem like a good approach, it is important to consider the characteristics of audio data and the limitations of the selected model. LSTM RNNs are a promising option for audio classification tasks due to their ability to handle temporal dependencies and variable-length data.

**Book Recommendation System**


Rapid internet development introduces the issue of information overload: users receive too much information to be able to select what is most useful. As a result, efficiency is reduced. Users can filter information with the help of many network applications. The problem of information overload cannot be solved with these methods alone since they only address basic needs. Providing personalized services to users through identifying and predicting their preferences, recommendation systems are a highly useful method for dealing with information overload [2]. This paper presents the Book Recommendation system where the system provides efficient recommendations to the users based on their interests. The main objective of this paper is to compare collaborative and content-based filtering systems and decide which is better based on accuracy scores. A machine learning algorithm called K-Nearest Neighbor was chosen with Cosine and Pearson similarity metrics for measuring the distances between the data points and recommending 5 similar books based on their similarities.
